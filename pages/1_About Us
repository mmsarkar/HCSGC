st.subheader("Our Mission: ")
st.write("hack.her was created to foster connections and create opportunities for women in computer science, a significantly male dominated field. The founders were inspired to create this project when they noticed how scared they felt to talk to anyone in their classes, and how few women they encountered. hack.her ensures that no woman will feel alone, matching them up with mentors and creating a safe space to talk to their peers. The resources that hack.her provides on hackathons, coding classes, and coding related majors allows for easily accessible information to further academic development. Although hack.her is centered around people identifying as women, it is open and helpful to anyone regardless of gender identity.\n")
